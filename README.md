# QuackingQuokkas' QR Code contact information for lost pets :paw_prints:

This service is for pet owners to have a more advanced way to attatch their contact information to their pets. When a **QR Code** attatched to the pet (say a small token on a collar) is scanned, the user is prompted with information about the pet and options to contact the owner, through **email** and/or **phone**. 

## Technology

This project was built using the ***MERN stack***. It uses a **React web-app** for entering the data about owner and pets and for displaying the information to whoever scanned the **QR code**. In the backend, it uses **Express** to register the information passed from the front end and it uses **MongoDB Atlas** to store the data.
